# AntiPacman
Anti-Pacman Game Implementation

This implementation provides a flipped version of the retro hit "Pacman", in which the player plays as Clyde the ghost and must stop the Pacmen from quickly eating every pellet.

Starting the game requires compiling and running src/AntiPacman.java, or plugging the project into an IDE.
